              Who We Are
            </h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 max-w-2xl mx-auto">
            At Shwe Pu Zun Bakery & Coffee House, we have proudly served delicious baked goods and beverages since we opened our first shop in 1978 at No 246/248, Anawrahta Road, Lanmadaw Township, Yangon. Over the years, we have expanded with two additional locationsâ€”Shop No. 2 in 2005 at No 14(A), Minnandar Road, Dawbon Township, Yangon, and Shop No. 3 in 2010 at Oaktarathiri Township, Nay Pyi Taw. At each of our shops, we offer a variety of bakery items, including cakes, cookies, bread, and pastries, alongside refreshing cold drinks.

We are also deeply involved in agriculture, ensuring the quality of the ingredients we use in our products. We have established Arabica Coffee & Rubber Plantations, as well as a Mango Orchard (Sein-ta-lone), in Yatsauk Township, Southern Shan State, and an additional Arabica Coffee Plantation in Pyin Oo Lwin Township, Mandalay Division. Through these efforts, we are committed to contributing to Myanmar's agricultural sector while offering fresh, high-quality products to our valued customers.
